(ns cn.li.ac.foundation.stateful
  "Stateful object pattern utilities.

  Provides infrastructure for building state machines and stateful objects
  with consistent:
  - State transitions
  - Lifecycle management
  - Disposal/cleanup
  - Validity checking

  Stateful objects are plain function maps with keys:
    :get-state    (fn [] -> current state)
    :set-state!   (fn [new-state] -> boolean)
    :valid?       (fn [] -> boolean)
    :dispose!     (fn [])
    :is-disposed? (fn [] -> boolean)"
  (:require [cn.li.ac.foundation.concurrency :as conc]
            [cn.li.mcmod.util.log :as log]))
