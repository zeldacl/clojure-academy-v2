  "Effect interpreter �?the Imperative Shell that executes effect plans.

  Receives the {:effects [...]} list produced by the reducer and
  dispatches each {:effect/type ...} plan to the appropriate handler.

  All handlers have side effects; none return meaningful values.
  The interpreter is the ONLY place in the ability system that talks
  to external systems (network, platform, persistence, events).

  Supported effect types:
    :network-send    �?mark player dirty, triggering auto-sync to client
    :platform-call   �?call a registered platform function via hooks registry
    :persist-state   �?mark player dirty, triggering NBT save
    :fire-event      �?fire an ability lifecycle event
    :radiation-index-sync �?resync the derived radiation-mark read index

  Unrecognised effect types are logged as warnings and skipped."
