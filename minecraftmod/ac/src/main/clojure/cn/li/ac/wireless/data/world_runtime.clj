  entities are swept out periodically instead of only at world save.

  Networks are driven from a due-tick bucket schedule (see store.clj's
  schedule-network-due!) instead of a full scan — each fires only on its own
  stagger slot. Connections still iterate every registered connection every
  tick: energy transfer runs unconditionally each tick (only the connection's
  own integrity validation is interval-staggered inside tick-node-conn!), so
  bucketing the driver loop would silently throttle live transfer instead of
  just skipping redundant work.

  Pending world-load rebuilds (see drain-pending-rebuilds!) are committed
  before the tick's state snapshot is taken, so entries rebuilt this tick
  are ticked starting this same tick rather than the next one."
