  "Recompute contexts/hud-model/background-mask/skill-slot-shape only when

  Two independent sub-keys, matching the split already proven correct for
  the (now-superseded) client-ui-hooks frame cache:
  - contexts/hud-model/background-mask key off whole player-state identity —
    resource-data (cp/overload) can legitimately change every server tick via
    continuous regen, and hud-model must reflect that, so this cache mostly
    saves the several render frames between two server ticks, not ticks
    themselves.
  - skill-slot-shape (registry/skill lookups) keys off preset-data identity
    alone, per build-skill-slot-shape's own documented contract: it depends
    only on active-slots (preset-data), not cooldown/context/resource data,
    so it must not be invalidated by cp/overload ticking or cooldown countdown.

  Server sync applies a whole-map replaceState on any player-state change
  (see runtime-store/set-player-state!), so `identical?` on player-state (and
  on the preset-data value nested within it) is a valid, zero-cost change
  token: guaranteed stale exactly when the underlying value would differ.
