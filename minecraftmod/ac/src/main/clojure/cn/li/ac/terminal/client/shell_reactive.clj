(ns cn.li.ac.terminal.client.shell-reactive
  "Complete reactive terminal UI aligned with upstream AcademyCraft TerminalUI.

   Owns everything that does not need Minecraft: the virtual pointer and its
   smoothing, edge scrolling, 3x3 selection with audio, the app grid and its
   stagger fade-in, the game-time clock and the loading animation.

   The perspective camera and the reticle it carries are Minecraft-side, reached
   through the :terminal-apply-perspective! and :terminal-render-cursor! bridge
   ops; each version's terminal-render namespace implements them on top of the
   shared platform terminal-camera implementation."
