  "MagMovement skill - magnetic acceleration toward metal blocks/entities.

  Mechanics:
  - Raycast to metal blocks/entities
  - Accelerate player toward target with smooth interpolation
  - Energy and progression values are read from ability skill config
  - Accept both normal and weak metal blocks, matching the original's effective check
  - Visual: Arc with wiggle animation
  - Audio: Looping ambient sound
  - Resets fall damage on completion
  - Grants experience based on distance traveled"
