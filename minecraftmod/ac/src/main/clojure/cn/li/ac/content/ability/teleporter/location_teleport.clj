(ns cn.li.ac.content.ability.teleporter.location-teleport
  "LocationTeleport saved-location server logic: query/save/delete/perform,
  exposed to the client only through the MSG-REQ-SAVED-POS-* RPC handlers
  registered by init!.

  Original-aligned mechanics:
  - CP consume: lerp(200,150,exp) * dim-penalty(2x cross-dim) * max(8, sqrt(min(800, distance)))
  - Overload consume: 240
  - Cross-dimension requires exp > 0.8
  - Teleport nearby entities in radius 5 with relative offsets preserved
  - Cooldown: lerp(30,20,exp)
  - Exp gain: 0.015 (dist<200) or 0.03 (dist>=200)
  - Location name max length: 16

  Skill declaration and the :instant activation shortcut are native to
  combat_content.clj; this namespace is not Context/defskill glue — it is
  the live implementation the RPC handlers call into.

  No Minecraft imports."
