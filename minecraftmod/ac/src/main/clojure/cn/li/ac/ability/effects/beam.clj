(ns cn.li.ac.ability.effects.beam
  "Beam shooting effect op shared between railgun, meltdowner, and similar skills.

  The :beam op fires a wide cylindrical beam from the player's eye position.
  Reflection callbacks are passed via the event map (not params) to avoid
  resolve-params calling them prematurely:
    :reflect-can-fn  (fn [uuid incoming-damage] -> bool)  called to check each candidate
    :reflect-shot-fn (fn [uuid incoming-damage] -> bool?) called when reflection triggers, returns hit?
  incoming-damage is the (falloff-scaled) damage that candidate would have
  taken had it not reflected — matches cn.li.ac.content.ability.shared.vec-reflection-interaction's
  2-arg (fn [target-player-uuid incoming-damage] ...) contract."
