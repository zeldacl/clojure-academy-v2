  "Shared hold-channel mining ray base logic for Basic/Expert/Luck variants.

  Each variant provides parameterized configuration; this namespace
  provides the actual tick/up/down implementations.

  Mining ray mechanic (matches original's MRContext):
  - Raycast in look direction each tick
  - Acquiring a NEW block only captures it (no countdown progress that tick)
  - Continuing to aim at the SAME block decrements a hardness countdown
  - Player must keep aiming at the same block to continue countdown
  - Mine-ray-luck grants fortune-style extra drops
  - Overload floor is snapshotted on activation and re-enforced every tick
  - Cooldown is applied on every termination path (up/abort/tick cost-fail)

  No Minecraft imports."
