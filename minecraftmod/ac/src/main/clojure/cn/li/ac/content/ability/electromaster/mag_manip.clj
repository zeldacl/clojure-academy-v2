  "MagManip skill - grab a magnetizable block, hold it, throw it on key release.

  Pattern: :release-cast
  Cost:     CP lerp(140,270) / overload lerp(35,20) - only charged when holding block nearby
  Cooldown: manual, lerp(60,40) ticks by exp
  Exp:      +0.005 on successful throw

  Matches original AcademyCraft MagManipContext: the held/thrown block is a
  real physics entity (entity_magmanip_block_body) that homes toward the
  player's aim while held and gets a one-shot velocity on throw — damage and
  block placement both come from the entity's own real collision (see
  ScriptedBlockBodyEntity.onHitEntity/onHit), not from instant hit-scan math."
