  "Port of RendererRayComposite — the shared shape every AC ray entity is drawn
  with (railgun, mdray_small, meltdowner's rays...).

  Upstream stacks three things along the ray:

    RendererRayGlow      three boards: blend_in over the first `width` units,
                         tile over the middle, blend_out over the last `width`,
                         each `width` across (drawBoard halves it), with the
                         ray extended by startFix / endFix. These are the only
                         TEXTURED part -- they draw through ShaderSimple.
    RendererRayCylinder  an outer tube of radius `width`, and
    RendererRayCylinder  an inner tube, both DIV=12 surfaces of revolution with
                         a y = sqrt(x) paraboloid head at each end (headFix
                         0.98 on the inner one). Both draw through ShaderNotex
                         -- notex.frag, pure vertex colour, NO texture.

  Callers supply the radii, colours and textures; the geometry is identical
  across skills, which is exactly why upstream has one class for it.

  ORDER MATTERS, in the order listed above. RendererRayComposite appends glow,
  then cylinderIn, then cylinderOut, and RendererList draws in append order.
  The tubes are translucent AND write depth, so whichever tube lands first
  wins the depth test wherever they overlap:

    glow before the tubes  -- the glow is a halo: it tests depth but never
                              writes it (see glow-ops), so wherever a tube sits
                              in front of it the glow's fragments drop out and
                              the ray reads as a round beam, not a sheet.
    inner before outer     -- the outer shell is only alpha 50; if it draws
                              first it stamps depth over the alpha-230 core
                              nested inside it, and that core is what makes a
                              ray look solid. Getting this backwards left the
                              beam patchily solid and hollow as the angle
                              changed, since the two only overlap where the
                              shell's near wall is between you and the core."
