  "Effectful input processor — the Imperative Shell for client key input.

  This namespace is the ONLY place that:
    1. Reads key-state atoms
    2. Calls state machine (pure) to compute what action to take
    3. Executes that action (calls delegate fns / API layer)
    4. Writes back updated key state

  Callers (keybinds.clj) delegate on-skill-key-event, on-movement-key-event,
  on-gui-key-event here after providing the player-state and runtime context.

  No business logic lives here — only wiring."
