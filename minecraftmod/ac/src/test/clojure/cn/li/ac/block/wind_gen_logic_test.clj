  "Wind generator structure-scan and client-sync regression tests.

  Two bugs fixed here:
  1. find-main-above-from-base scanned from base.y+1, but the base multiblock
     occupies two vertical blocks (controller + part at y+1) - the scan hit the
     part, matched neither pillar nor main, and judged every tower BASE_ONLY
     (base GUI structure icons stayed dark). Upstream starts at y+2.
  2. wind-gen-main-schema fields the TESR reads (:complete/:no-obstacle/
     :fan-installed) lacked :client-sync?, so the client BE custom-state never
     updated and the fan never rendered."
