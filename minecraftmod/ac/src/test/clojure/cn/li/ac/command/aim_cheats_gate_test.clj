  "Guards the /aim cheat switch.

  Refusing the other subcommands is the entire observable effect of
  cheats_on — upstream CommandAIM.execute bails with `notactive` on every
  subcommand until isActive(player), exempting creative mode. Without the
  gate the switch flips a flag nothing reads, so `/aim cheats_on` reports
  success and changes nothing."
