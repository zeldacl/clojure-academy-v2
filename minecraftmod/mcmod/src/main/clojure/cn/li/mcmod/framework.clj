  "Single framework state container.

   Created once per logical side (client/server) at mod entry.
   Holds ALL content registries, runtime services, AND platform adapters.

   All .clj business files read state from this single atom.
   No other def/delay/atom/defonce allowed in business namespaces.

   Thread safety:
     - :registry/* — write-once (init phase), then freeze → lock-free HAMT reads
     - :service/* — runtime read/write via Facade API guard functions
     - :platform/* — write-once (bootstrap), then read-only function map lookups

   Exactly-once init guards live at :service/:install/:flags, written only
   via cn.li.mcmod.runtime.install/framework-once! — see that namespace for
   the two sanctioned exactly-once primitives (framework-once! / process-once!)."
