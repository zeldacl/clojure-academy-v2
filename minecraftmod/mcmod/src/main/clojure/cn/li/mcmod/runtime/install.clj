  "Unified exactly-once / SPI injection primitives.

   Replaces all other init-guard shapes (defonce-guard atoms, ^:dynamic
   boolean guards + Object locks, top-level let-closure atoms) project-wide.

   Two exactly-once entry points:
   - framework-once! — flag lives inside the Framework atom. A fresh
     Framework injection (with-fresh-framework in tests, or a real
     integrated-server world reload) resets the flag automatically, so
     the guarded action re-runs. Use for anything whose effect is scoped
     to Framework registries/services (content registration, SPI wiring
     that reads/writes the Framework atom).
   - process-once! — flag lives in a single process-wide atom (the one
     new top-level atom this namespace introduces; whitelisted). Use only
     for genuine JVM-level one-shot side effects that must NOT redo on
     Framework reinjection: event-bus listener registration, native/GLFW
     hookup, defmethod dispatch-table loading.

   install-root! replaces the '^:dynamic + Object lock + alter-var-root'
   three-piece SPI-holder pattern with a plain root-bound var."
