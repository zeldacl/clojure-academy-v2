  "Single shared command feedback implementation, vanilla-aligned.

  translate? true → send Component.translatable(key, args): the CLIENT resolves
  the key against its own lang files (assets/<modid>/lang/<locale>.json), so
  dedicated servers need no language data and each player sees their own
  locale — matching vanilla, where the packet carries key+args only and the
  server never translates player-facing feedback. NOTE: the client-side
  formatter (TranslatableContents) supports only %s / %n$s specifiers.
  translate? false → literal text; args (if any) are applied with format.

  error? true → sendFailure (red). Vanilla API asymmetry: sendSuccess takes
  Supplier<Component> (1.20.1) while sendFailure takes Component directly."
