(ns cn.li.mc1201.entity.hook-abstraction
  "Platform-agnostic entity operation function maps.

   Defines the expected function keys for entity adapter maps, allowing:
   - Unit testing of entity hooks with mock implementations
   - Easy porting to new Minecraft versions
   - Clear separation of business logic from platform details

   Each entity type documents its required function keys as a set.
   Adapter maps are plain Clojure maps where each key is an operation
   (e.g. :get-pos) and each value is a function that takes the
   Minecraft entity as its first argument.

   Usage example:
     (let [adapter (create-entity-adapter mc-entity ctx)]
       ((:get-pos adapter) (:minecraft-entity adapter)))")
