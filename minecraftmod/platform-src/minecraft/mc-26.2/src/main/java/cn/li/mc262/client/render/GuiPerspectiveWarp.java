/**
 * A frame-scoped projective warp for extracted GUI elements.
 *
 * <p>26.2 hands every GUI element a {@link Matrix3x2fc} pose. That can express
 * translation, rotation, scale and shear, but not the projective term that makes
 * a rotated plane's far edge shorter than its near edge. AcademyCraft's terminal
 * is drawn through a real {@code gluPerspective} camera whose far edge is ~20%
 * shorter than its near edge, so an affine pose renders it as a parallelogram
 * instead of a trapezoid — the panel is placed and tilted correctly but reads as
 * flat.</p>
 *
 * <p>The terminal is a plane and the camera is a pinhole, so the whole chain
 * collapses exactly into a 3x3 homography. Drawing helpers ask {@link #active()}
 * and, when a warp is installed, project their own geometry through it instead of
 * handing the pose to vanilla. {@code null} means no warp, so every other UI keeps
 * the untouched affine path.</p>
 *
 * <p>Client render thread only. The matrix is row-major:
 * {@code [Xw Yw w] = H * [x y 1]}, screen = {@code (Xw/w, Yw/w)}.</p>
