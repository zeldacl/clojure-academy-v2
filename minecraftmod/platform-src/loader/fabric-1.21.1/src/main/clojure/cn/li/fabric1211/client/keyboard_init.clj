(ns cn.li.fabric1211.client.keyboard-init
  "Fabric client keyboard input initialization.

   Purpose: Bootstrap AC keybindings and install polling.
   Fabric has no KeyMapping event dispatch, so AC input relies on GLFW
   polling for both :alternative and :original scheme inputs — but the
   :alternative KeyMappings ARE registered via fabric KeyBindingHelper (they
   show in vanilla Options > Controls and feed the Settings app rebind rows),
   and the polling resolves the CURRENT binding so rebinds take effect."
