  "Shared energy adapter core - implements platform-agnostic energy interface adapters.

  This namespace provides ~75% of energy adapter logic that can be shared
  between Forge and Fabric. It implements the common patterns used by both
  ForgeEnergyAdapter and potential Fabric energy adapters.

  Platform-specific parts (Forge capability registration, Fabric event listeners)
  remain in platform layers."
