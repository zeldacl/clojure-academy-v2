# Platform expansion docs

This directory documents the current target-catalog platform architecture.

Use these rules for all loader/version work:

- One Gradle project: `:platform`.
- One target catalog: `platform-targets.json`.
- Explicit source components; no target-id string parsing.
- No generated cartesian product of loader/version combinations.
- No platform bootstrap SPI or ServiceLoader platform bootstrap files.
- No real new-loader source tree, dependency, release artifact, or support promise unless the project intentionally adds that supported target.
- Use synthetic fixtures for architecture-only expansion tests.
